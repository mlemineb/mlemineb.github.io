It's been a long time coming but I finally moved my blog from Jekyll/Bootstrap on Github pages to blogdown, Hugo and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)! Moreover, I also now have my own domain name [www.shirin-glander.de](https://www.shirin-glander.de). :-)

I followed the [blogdown ebook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) to set up my blog. I chose Thibaud LeprÃªtre's [tranquilpeak theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/). It looks much more polished than my old blog.

My old blog will remain where it is, so that all the links that are out there will still work (and I don't have to go through the hassle of migrating all my posts to my new site).

From this point on, all new posts will go up on [my new page](https://www.shirin-glander.de)!
