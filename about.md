hhhhhhhhhhhhhh

My tool of choice for data analysis so far has been R. I also organize the [MÃ¼nsteR R-users group on meetup.com](https://shiring.github.io/r_users_group/2017/05/20/muenster_r_user_group).

I love dancing and used to do competitive ballroom and latin dancing. Even though I don't have time for that anymore, I still enjoy teaching "social dances" once a week with the Hochschulsport (university sports courses).

I created the R package [exprAnalysis](https://github.com/ShirinG/exprAnalysis), designed to streamline my RNA-seq data analysis pipeline. It is available via Github. Instructions for installation and usage can be found [here](https://shiring.github.io/rna-seq/microarray/2016/09/28/exprAnalysis).

This blog will showcase some of the analyses I have been doing with different data sets (all freely available). I will also host teaching materials for students to access in conjunction with R courses I am giving.
