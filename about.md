Graduated with an international Master degree in Statistics and Econometrics from the Toulouse School of Economics ,  Iâ€™m working as a Junior Data Scientist at the Credit Agricole.
During my academic and professional career , I devoted my work on innovation and data science by performing several projects related to a large spectrum of topics and by constantly trying to learn new things through MOOCs or experienced people.
I find data science fascinating as it is a very challenging concept. In my environment, Data Science fosters innovation, and innovation creates value.


So far my favorite tool for performing data analysis has been R. I also have big interest for other languages , specially python , which I use more for Computer vision project .

I love soccer, reading about other cultures and travaling . I think that we always learn new things from people and every human being is  very special .

This blog will showcase some of the analyses I have been doing with different data sets (all freely available or scraped from the web).
